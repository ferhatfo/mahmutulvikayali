Non-surgical methods are not alternatives to rhinoplasty (nose aesthetic) surgery. They are essentially filler applications that aim to approach aesthetic proportions by creating small, temporary (approximately 8-12 months) changes in the nose.</p>\n    <p class=\"font-semibold text-red-600\">Structural problems requiring surgery cannot be corrected with this method. The procedure must be planned and applied by an experienced aesthetic surgeon with advanced anatomical knowledge.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Why is Safety Important in Nose Fillers?</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">The nose area is a region with extremely dense vascular connections. Especially in areas with strong connective tissue like the nasal tip, skin elasticity is limited; therefore, the risk of complications may be higher compared to other facial areas.</p>\n    <p class=\"font-semibold text-green-600\">When applied with the correct technique in appropriately selected cases, the procedure is safe; however, incorrect applications can disrupt tissue circulation.</p>\n    <p class=\"mt-4\">Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeon Op. Dr. Mahmut Ulvi Kayalı performs non-surgical rhinoplasty (nose filler) procedures by holistically evaluating facial proportions and creating personalized plans.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Which Fillers Are Used? Are They Harmful to the Body?</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">Hyaluronic acid (HA) based fillers are frequently preferred in non-surgical rhinoplasty:</p>\n    <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n      <li><strong>They are tissue-friendly and reversible substances</strong></li>\n      <li><strong>They are absorbed by the body over time;</strong> maintaining volume effect in the area for a certain period</li>\n      <li><strong>Allergic reaction rate is low</strong></li>\n      <li><strong>Can be dissolved with hyaluronidase if necessary</strong> (reversible)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">What Can Be Done with Nose Fillers?</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">The following minor shape irregularities can be camouflaged without resorting to surgery:</p>\n    <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n      <li><strong>Small depressions or asymmetries on the nasal bridge</strong> can be balanced by filling the opposite side</li>\n      <li><strong>If the nasal starting point (nasofrontal angle) is too far back,</strong> it can be elevated for harmony with the nasal bridge</li>\n      <li><strong>Small bone protrusions</strong> can be camouflaged with appropriate filler planning; the profile appears straighter</li>\n      <li><strong>If the nasal tip is drooping,</strong> a more elevated appearance can be given with limited volume support</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p class=\"font-semibold text-gray-700\">Note: The rules of these procedures are not standard; every face is different. Therefore, every application should be planned individually.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Advantages and Limitations</h3>\n    <div class=\"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6\">\n      <div>\n        <h4 class=\"font-bold text-green-700 mb-3\">Advantages:</h4>\n        <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2\">\n          <li><strong>Non-surgical;</strong> short procedure time (approximately 15-20 minutes)</li>\n          <li><strong>Quick return to social life</strong></li>\n          <li><strong>Reversible</strong> (can be dissolved if necessary)</li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <h4 class=\"font-bold text-orange-700 mb-3\">Limitations:</h4>\n        <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2\">\n          <li><strong>Permanence is temporary</strong> (approximately 8-12 months)</li>\n          <li><strong>Surgery (rhinoplasty) is required for structural curvatures, breathing problems, or significant deformities</strong></li>\n          <li><strong>Should only be applied by a specialist physician due to high vascular density in the area</strong></li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Conclusion</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">Non-surgical rhinoplasty (nose filler) is a suitable option for selected patients who do not want surgery and seek small, temporary adjustments.

The main purpose of these surgeries is to obtain a nose that is proportional to the face, natural and aesthetic.</p>\n    <p>Primary rhinoplasty is the first nose aesthetic procedure performed on patients who have not had any previous surgical intervention on the nose.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">WHAT IS A BEAUTIFUL NOSE?</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">A beautiful nose is one that is compatible with the general structure of the face, balanced, and provides aesthetic integrity without drawing attention.</p>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">The main elements that make a nose look beautiful are:</p>\n    <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2\">\n      <li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> It is the basic indicator of a healthy and balanced appearance.</li>\n      <li><strong>Balance and Proportion:</strong> The nose should be compatible with other areas of the face (a small nose for a small face, a more proportional nose for a wider face).</li>\n      <li><strong>Naturalness:</strong> It should give a young, elegant and lively expression without distorting the character of the face.</li>\n      <li><strong>Aesthetic Compatibility:</strong> It should integrate with the person's facial features and emphasize beauty without drawing attention.</li>\n      <li><strong>Cultural Harmony:</strong> Natural harmony should be achieved by considering each individual's genetic and cultural characteristics.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p class=\"mt-4\">The concept of beauty varies from person to person, from culture to culture. Therefore, a successful rhinoplasty should be planned not only according to certain ratios, but also according to the person's facial anatomy, skin structure and expectations.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">AESTHETIC UNDERSTANDING AND SCIENTIFIC BALANCE</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">Many ratios and angles for the \"ideal nose\" have been defined in the plastic surgery literature. However, for an experienced surgeon, these ratios are only a guide.</p>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">During surgery, each patient's facial structure, bone and cartilage characteristics, skin thickness and ethnic structure are evaluated and a unique planning is made.</p>\n    <p class=\"font-semibold text-gray-700\">A successful nose aesthetic is the combination of scientific knowledge and artistic perspective.</p>\n    <p class=\"mt-4\">Op. Dr. Mahmut Ulvi Kayalı aims to achieve natural, functional and aesthetic results by analyzing each patient's facial ratios in detail in his clinic in Antalya.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">PATIENT EXPECTATIONS AND PLANNING</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">Almost all people who want to have nose aesthetics are dissatisfied with a specific feature of their nose. This could be:</p>\n    <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n      <li>Nasal hump,</li>\n      <li>Size of the nose,</li>\n      <li>Drooping nasal tip,</li>\n      <li>Base width or asymmetry.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">The most important stage in primary rhinoplasty planning is to understand the patient's complaints and combine them with the surgeon's aesthetic perspective.</p>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">Op. Dr. Mahmut Ulvi Kayalı analyzes the patient's face and nose in digital environment during examination and shows the patient the possible post-operative appearance with simulation method.</p>\n    <p class=\"font-semibold text-blue-600\">This process ensures strong communication between the patient and the surgeon. Planning is the determining factor in the success of rhinoplasty surgery.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">OPERATION (OPEN AND CLOSED TECHNIQUES)</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">Nose aesthetic surgeries can be applied with closed or open technique. Both methods have advantages and reasons for preference.</p>\n    \n    <div class=\"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"bg-white p-4 rounded-lg\">\n        <h4 class=\"font-bold text-lg mb-3 text-blue-600\">Open Rhinoplasty</h4>\n        <p class=\"mb-3\">A small incision is made at the bottom of the nose and the nasal skin is lifted. This allows the surgeon to see the nasal structures directly and intervene in a more controlled manner.</p>\n        <p class=\"mb-3\">This method is especially preferred in patients with serious structural curvatures, secondary or tertiary surgeries.</p>\n        <p class=\"text-sm text-gray-600\">The location of the incision usually becomes completely faint within a year.</p>\n      </div>\n      \n      <div class=\"bg-white p-4 rounded-lg\">\n        <h4 class=\"font-bold text-lg mb-3 text-green-600\">Closed Rhinoplasty</h4>\n        <p class=\"mb-3\">The incision is made inside the nose, leaving no external scar.</p>\n        <p class=\"mb-3\">All interventions that can be done with open technique can also be applied with closed technique.</p>\n        <p class=\"text-sm text-gray-600\">Surgery time may be slightly longer in patients with serious structural problems.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    \n    <p class=\"font-semibold\">Which surgery technique will be chosen is determined together with the patient during the preliminary interview at the office of Aesthetic, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Specialist Op. Dr. Mahmut Ulvi Kayalı in Antalya.</p>\n    <p>Op. Dr. Mahmut Ulvi Kayalı frequently uses both surgery techniques.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">COMBINING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL NASAL PROCEDURES</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">The inside and outside of the nose are a whole. Curvatures inside the nose (septum deviation) usually occur together with external asymmetry.</p>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">Therefore, the most correct approach is to perform aesthetic (rhinoplasty) and functional (septoplasty) procedures in the same session.</p>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">Cartilage tissues inside the nose are used to support the nasal tip or strengthen the nasal roof when necessary.</p>\n    <p class=\"font-semibold text-blue-600\">If there is not enough cartilage in patients who have had previous nasal surgery, ear or rib cartilage can be used as a second source.</p>\n    <p class=\"mt-4\">This method improves both breathing function and aesthetic result at the same time.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-teal-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">POSTOPERATIVE PERIOD</h3>\n    <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-3\">\n      <li><strong>Mild nausea or chills</strong> may occur within the first few hours after surgery.</li>\n      <li>Op. Dr. Mahmut Ulvi Kayalı usually prefers not to place tampons inside the nose.</li>\n      <li>If internal curvature has been corrected, special silicone tampons that can stay for 1 day and do not stick to the nose can be used.</li>\n      <li>There are plastic cast and tapes on the nose after surgery. Cold application is done in the first 24 hours.</li>\n      <li>Pain is mild on the first evening and can be controlled with painkillers.</li>\n      <li>Pain is minimal from the 2nd day onwards.</li>\n      <li>Bruising and edema usually decrease within 1 week.</li>\n      <li>Dressings and stitches are removed in the <strong>1st week</strong>, the patient can return to social life in the <strong>2nd week</strong>.</li>\n      <li>70% of swelling decreases in the <strong>2nd month</strong>, the final nose form settles within <strong>1 year</strong>.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">CONCLUSION</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">Primary rhinoplasty (nose aesthetic) not only improves appearance but also provides functionally more comfortable breathing.</p>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">The goal of the surgery is to create a nose that is compatible with the person's facial features, natural, elegant and balanced.</p>\n    <p class=\"font-semibold\">Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeon Op.

Tertiary rhinoplasty refers to the third correction surgery performed on patients who have undergone two or more operations.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Why is a Separate Definition Needed?</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">Secondary or tertiary rhinoplasty operations require much more experience, patience and attention compared to primary rhinoplasty surgeries. The reasons for this are:</p>\n    <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2\">\n      <li><strong>Tissue adhesions due to previous surgery</strong> make it difficult to clarify anatomical plans.</li>\n      <li><strong>Since the nasal skin has thinned in the previous surgery,</strong> it can make irregularities in the underlying cartilage or bone more noticeable.</li>\n      <li><strong>Collapse or loss of support in the nasal bridge</strong> may occur after excessive cartilage removal.</li>\n      <li><strong>Hole (perforation) may occur in the internal nasal tissue</strong> due to mucosal and cartilage damage.</li>\n      <li><strong>Since the previous surgery was performed by a different surgeon,</strong> the techniques and graft information used may not be fully known.</li>\n      <li><strong>Therefore, the surgery time is longer and surgical planning must be more detailed.</strong></li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Techniques Used in Secondary Rhinoplasty Surgery</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">The aim in these surgeries is to restore structure and support to the nose. In most cases, it is necessary to take grafts from another part of the body to replace cartilage or bone tissues that were removed in the previous surgery.</p>\n    \n    <div class=\"grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"bg-white p-4 rounded-lg\">\n        <h4 class=\"font-bold text-lg mb-2 text-blue-600\">Ear Cartilage</h4>\n        <p class=\"text-sm\">(Conchal cartilage): Ideal for nasal tip support due to its flexible structure.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"bg-white p-4 rounded-lg\">\n        <h4 class=\"font-bold text-lg mb-2 text-green-600\">Rib Cartilage</h4>\n        <p class=\"text-sm\">(Costal cartilage): Provides strong support in advanced deformities.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"bg-white p-4 rounded-lg\">\n        <h4 class=\"font-bold text-lg mb-2 text-purple-600\">Fascia</h4>\n        <p class=\"text-sm\">(Muscle sheath): Used to soften superficial irregularities and provide natural contour.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    \n    <p class=\"font-semibold text-blue-600\">Op.

Its front part is cartilage, while its back part consists of bone tissue. A healthy septum should be located exactly in the midline and provide equal airflow to both nostrils.</p>\n    <p>The bending of the septum to one side is called septum deviation (nasal curvature). This condition causes reduced airflow or complete blockage on the side where the curvature is located. As a result, complaints such as breathing difficulty, nasal congestion, snoring and sinusitis tendency may occur.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Why Does Septum Deviation Occur?</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">Septum deviation usually occurs due to traumas experienced in childhood, nasal fractures or congenital developmental disorders. In some cases, cartilage development may develop curved spontaneously without any external cause.</p>\n    <p class=\"font-semibold text-red-600\">Not every curvature requires surgery. What is important is whether this curvature causes functional problems in the patient such as shortness of breath, headache or recurrent sinusitis.</p>\n    <p class=\"mt-2\">If these complaints are present, surgical correction (septoplasty) is necessary.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Can Septoplasty and Nose Aesthetics Be Performed Together?</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">The nose is a whole in terms of both facial aesthetics and respiratory function. Therefore, curvatures in the nasal cartilage usually cause shape disorders in the external nose appearance. In these cases, it is ideal to perform septum deviation surgery (septoplasty) and nose aesthetics (rhinoplasty) operation in the same session.</p>\n    \n    <div class=\"bg-white p-4 rounded-lg mb-4\">\n      <p class=\"font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-2\">Op. Dr. Mahmut Ulvi Kayalı always considers the functional structure in nose aesthetic planning.</p>\n      <p class=\"mb-2\">In patients who have had septoplasty before and whose cartilage tissue has been removed after surgery, rhinoplasty operation may become more complex. Because septum cartilage is necessary for shaping the nasal tip, supporting the bridge and providing a natural appearance.</p>\n      <p class=\"font-semibold\">If these cartilages have been removed, cartilage graft may need to be taken from the ear or rib.</p>\n    </div>\n    \n    <p class=\"font-semibold text-green-600\">Therefore, in patients with both breathing problems and aesthetic concerns, performing septoplasty and rhinoplasty surgeries in the same session provides healthier and more permanent results.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">What is Concha and What Does It Do?</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">Concha are anatomical structures located inside the nasal cavity and extending on the side wall of the nose, resembling a radiator. During breathing, these structures heat, humidify and filter the air.</p>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">In some people, concha may be larger than normal. This condition is called concha hypertrophy and can make breathing difficult.</p>\n    <p class=\"font-semibold text-blue-600\">If concha size causes breathing problems, concha reduction procedure can also be applied during nose aesthetics (rhinoplasty).</p>\n    <p class=\"mt-2\">This way, the patient both breathes more comfortably and obtains an aesthetically balanced nose.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Conclusion</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">Septum deviation is not only a breathing problem but also a condition that affects nose aesthetics. In patients experiencing nasal curvature and congestion, performing septoplasty and rhinoplasty operations together is the most correct approach both functionally and aesthetically.</p>\n    <p class=\"font-semibold\">Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeon Op. Dr. Mahmut Ulvi Kayalı performs septum deviation, septoplasty and nose aesthetic surgeries in his clinic in Antalya with modern surgical principles, providing both natural appearance and healthy breathing together.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>",

During puberty, many boys experience temporary breast growth, firmness, or tenderness. This condition is called physiological gynecomastia and usually resolves spontaneously after puberty.</p><p>In adult men, the most common form is idiopathic gynecomastia, which accounts for about 85% of all cases. It occurs without any underlying disease or hormonal disorder.</p></div><div class=\"bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">How Is Gynecomastia Surgery Performed?</h3><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2\"><li><strong>Liposuction:</strong> Preferred in about 90% of patients. Excess fatty tissue is removed effectively with liposuction.</li><li><strong>Fibroglandular tissue excision:</strong> In cases with firm glandular tissue under the nipple, a small incision is made to remove it along with liposuction.</li><li><strong>Total breast excision:</strong> Rarely performed, as it prolongs healing and increases the risk of irregularities.</li></ul></div><div class=\"bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Scars After Surgery</h3><p>Small incisions of about 2-3 mm are made under the breast or in the armpit. <strong class=\"text-green-600\">These fade significantly within 6 months and become barely visible.</strong></p></div><div class=\"bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Preoperative Evaluation</h3><p>The success of gynecomastia surgery depends on a careful preoperative evaluation. At the private clinic of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery Specialist Dr. Mahmut Ulvi Kayalı in Antalya, Turkey, the patient's breast structure, degree of enlargement, skin quality, and presence of sagging are thoroughly assessed.</p></div><div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Recovery Process</h3><p>A compression garment is worn for about 1 month. Most patients return to work and daily life within 5-7 days. The skin and chest contour adapt to the new form within about 6 months.</p></div><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-4\">Gynecomastia Surgery in Antalya, Turkey</h3><p>Gynecomastia can cause both physical and psychological discomfort in men.Dr. Mahmut Ulvi Kayalı performs gynecomastia surgeries in Antalya, Turkey, following modern surgical principles.</p></div><p class=\"mt-6\">Dr. Mahmut Ulvi Kayalı performs gynecomastia surgeries in Antalya, Turkey, following modern surgical principles.</p></div>"

Instead of simply pulling and tightening the skin, it targets the supportive tissues beneath the skin. The SMAS layer, malar fat pads, and ligaments are released and lifted together with the cheeks, jawline, and neck deep tissues.</p></div><div class=\"bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Signs of Facial Aging</h3><p>As age progresses, the face loses its youthful dynamic triangular form:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2\"><li>Cheeks descend due to gravity, <strong>reducing cheekbone prominence</strong></li><li><strong>Nasolabial folds deepen</strong></li><li><strong>Jawline becomes undefined</strong>, with sagging 'jowls' appearing on the sides</li><li>In the neck, <strong>platysma muscle laxity causes vertical bands</strong> and excess skin</li><li><strong>Skin elasticity decreases</strong>, creating a looser and more wrinkled appearance</li></ul><p>Patients often complain of looking tired, sad, or older than they actually are when they look in the mirror.</p></div><div class=\"bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">What is Deep Plane Facelift?</h3><p>The deep plane facelift is an advanced surgical technique that goes beyond traditional facelift procedures. Instead of simply pulling and tightening the skin, it targets the supportive tissues beneath:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2\"><li><strong>SMAS layer (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System):</strong> The muscle and fascial layer that supports the cheeks and jawline.</li><li><strong>Malar fat pads:</strong> Soft tissues over the cheekbones that descend with time, creating a sagging appearance.</li><li><strong>Ligaments (facial ligaments):</strong> Structures that anchor the cheeks, jawline, and neck muscles to the bone.</li></ul><p>In deep plane facelift, these ligaments (zygomatic, masseteric, mandibular, and platysma ligaments) are released. Thus, the cheeks, jawline, and neck are lifted together with deep tissues. The result is a natural, long-lasting facial appearance with restored youthful volume.</p></div><div class=\"bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Classic Facelift Techniques vs. Deep Plane Difference</h3><p>Techniques applied in classic facelift surgeries:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2\"><li><strong>Skin Only Facelift:</strong> Only excess skin is removed and tightened. The face appears tighter in the early period, but due to the elastic nature of the skin, sagging recurs quickly. Rarely preferred alone today.</li><li><strong>SMAS Plication:</strong> After the skin is lifted, sutures are placed on the superficial muscle layer called SMAS to tighten it. Provides longer-lasting results than skin-only method. However, since the SMAS layer is not repositioned, tension may decrease over time.</li><li><strong>SMASectomy:</strong> A portion of the SMAS layer is cut out and removed, and the remaining parts are sutured together to create tension. A stronger effect is achieved, but this technique is limited in lifting cheek volume.</li><li><strong>Deep Plane Facelift:</strong> A deeper and thicker tissue layer is elevated. This way, skin circulation in front of the ear is better preserved and scars heal much healthier. Since all tension is loaded on the SMAS layer, excessive stress is not placed on the skin incision line; this prevents scars from widening and keeps them finer. Since facial volume is lifted upward, the need for additional filler or fat injection is reduced. The result is a natural, long-lasting, and balanced facial appearance.</li></ul></div><div class=\"bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Preoperative Evaluation</h3><p>Detailed planning is essential for a successful facelift surgery. During the initial consultation at the clinic of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery Specialist Dr. Mahmut Ulvi Kayalı in Antalya:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2\"><li>The current anatomy of the face, skin quality, and aging signs are evaluated.</li><li>Photos and measurements are taken to create the most suitable surgical planning for the individual.</li><li>The patient's expectations (defining the jawline, lifting the cheeks, tightening the neck) are discussed in detail.</li></ul></div><div class=\"bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Where Are Scars Hidden?</h3><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2\"><li>Incisions made in deep plane facelift surgery are hidden in the natural folds in front of and behind the ear, and along the hairline.</li><li>They may be red and noticeable in the first months.</li><li>Within 6-12 months, their color lightens and blends with the skin tone.</li><li>Since circulation is better preserved in the deep plane, the quality of scar healing is significantly better compared to classical methods.</li></ul></div><div class=\"bg-teal-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Recovery Process</h3><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2\"><li><strong>First days:</strong> Edema, bruising, and tightness may occur.

With age, cheeks sag downward, under-eye area develops hollows and tired appearance, and nasolabial folds deepen. These changes give the person an older, tired, and unhappy expression than they actually are.</p></div><div class=\"bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">What is Subperiosteal Midface Lift?</h3><p>Subperiosteal midface lift is an advanced surgical technique that reaches the deep layers of the midface. In this method, cheek, under-eye, and midface tissues are released from the periosteum (bone membrane) and repositioned upward along the central axis. Thus, cheek sagging is corrected, under-eye hollows are eliminated, and nasolabial folds are significantly reduced.</p></div><div class=\"bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Surgical Technique</h3><p>The surgery is performed through small incisions hidden within the scalp. Using an endoscopic camera, the surgeon reaches the deep midface tissues and repositions them upward. It can be combined with classic facelift surgery or eyelid surgery. This provides more balanced and comprehensive facial rejuvenation.</p></div><div class=\"bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Preoperative Evaluation</h3><p>Preliminary consultation is of great importance for a successful operation.
