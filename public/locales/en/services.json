Non-surgical methods are not an alternative to rhinoplasty or nose aesthetic surgery. They are generally filling applications. By creating temporary (8-12 months) minor changes in the nose, it is tried to approach the aesthetic nose ratios.</p><p class=\"mb-6 font-semibold text-red-600\">The nose that needs surgery cannot be corrected with this method.</p><div class=\"bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">What Is Used in These Filling Applications? Is It Harmful to Our Body?</h3><p class=\"mb-4\">Fillers containing hyaluronic acid are often used, which are applied to our lips or face. These fillings are absorbed after a certain period of time. The volume effect continues in the area where it is given until it is absorbed.</p><p class=\"font-semibold text-green-600\">They are tissue friendly. Very rare reactions or allergies occur.</p></div><div class=\"bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">What Can Be Done With This Process, What Problems Can Be Solved?</h3><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\"><li><strong>Small depressions and asymmetries</strong> on the back of the nose can be camouflaged by filling the opposite side</li><li>If the <strong>starting point of the nose is too far back</strong>, it can be raised to match the ridge of the nose</li><li>If there is a <strong>small bone protrusion</strong>, this protrusion can be camouflaged by filling the ridge and tip of the nose</li><li>If the <strong>tip of the nose is low</strong>, the nose tip is filled with volume and the tip of the nose can be shown more raised</li></ul><p class=\"font-semibold text-gray-700\">In such applications, the experience and aesthetic perception of the physician is very important.

          "content": "<div class=\"prose max-w-none\"><p class=\"mb-4\">Rhinoplasty means shaping the nose in Greek. Today it is used to describe the plastic surgeries performed for the nose. The intended result in all of these surgeries is to obtain a beautiful nose.</p><div class=\"bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Beautiful Nose</h3><p class=\"mb-4\">A beautiful nose is a beautiful car or a beautiful house. All of these contain a number of common features:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2\"><li><strong>Symmetry</strong> (because symmetry is the characteristic of a healthy person, not carrying disease)</li><li><strong>Balance and Proportion</strong> (to be in harmony with its surroundings â€” a small nose for a small face)</li><li>Making you <strong>noticeable, enviable, enviable</strong> in your environment</li><li>Include <strong>cultural or class appreciation</strong> (associating wealth, upper socioeconomic class or upper sociocultural class characteristics)</li><li><strong>Fashion</strong> or carrying the popular values of that day</li></ul></div><p class=\"mb-6\">If beauty does not have a definite rule for every universal cross, how is the nose that one wants to see on one's own face be decided with a beautiful or more accurate description? First of all, almost all of the people who apply to a plastic surgery specialist are uncomfortable with a feature of their nose and apply with this complaint.</p><div class=\"bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Operation</h3><p class=\"mb-4\">Aesthetic nose surgery or rhinoplasty are different techniques that have been previously described or the flow order has been explained in detail. Closed or open techniques, which are popularly called scarless or scarred, are the basic nasal surgery methods.</p><p class=\"mb-2\"><strong>In open nose surgery:</strong> An incision is made in the lower part of the nose at a point between the tip of the nose and the lip, and the nasal skin is lifted from the back of the nose in the areas to be intervened. Surgery is done by sight.</p><p><strong>In the closed surgery technique:</strong> No incision is made on the nose. The area to be intervened is reached by incisions made through the nose and cannot be studied by sight.</p></div><div class=\"bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Can Nose Aesthetics and Internal Processes Be Done in the Same Session?</h3><p>The nose is a whole with its inside and outside. Curvatures and obstructions in the nose are usually noticed as deformity in the visible part of the nose. Therefore, the aesthetic and functional status of the nose should be evaluated together.</p></div><div class=\"bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Postoperative</h3><p class=\"mb-2\">The first half hour after the operation will be a little troublesome. I don't often insert a tampon in my surgeries.</p><p class=\"mb-2\">After the surgery, you will have plastic splints (support) and bands on your nose. On the first evening, there may be pain that can be reduced with a pain reliever and is usually tolerated.</p><p class=\"font-semibold text-green-600\">In the first month, 60-70% of the swelling disappears and an acceptable appearance is obtained.</p></div></div>"

To put it more clearly, it is the name given to the surgery to be performed on patients who are not satisfied with the surgery performed by another physician.</p><div class=\"bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Why Is a Separate Definition Needed for the Second Surgery?</h3><p class=\"mb-4\">Because secondary interventions to the nose require more experience and some difficulties are encountered:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\"><li><strong>Adhesions</strong> due to the previous surgery occur in the surgical area</li><li>Since the nose skin was opened before, the skin became <strong>thinner</strong></li><li>In the previous attempt, <strong>too much of the nasal bone or cartilage</strong> may have been removed</li><li>A <strong>hole (perforation)</strong> may have formed in the midline cartilage in the nose due to the mucous membrane and cartilage damage that occurred in the previous surgery</li><li>The <strong>operation time is longer</strong></li></ul><p class=\"font-semibold text-gray-700\">In secondary rhinoplasty surgeries, it may be necessary to bring cartilage or fascia (muscle membrane) from another part of the body in order to provide the old support to the nose.</p></div></div>"

The anterior part of this structure is cartilage, and the posterior part is bone. This structure should be straight to the midline and to provide equal ventilation to both air vents.</p><p>The curvatures of the structure that I describe as the septum in the midline of the nose are called septum deviation. If the septum is curved to one side, it means that the air hole on that side will be less ventilated, or perhaps no air will pass.</p></div><div class=\"bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Why Does Septum Deviation Occur?</h3><p>Septum deviation may develop due to traumas developed in infancy or childhood, nasal fractures. In some cases, cartilage development may be curved for no apparent reason.</p></div><div class=\"bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">Should Nose Aesthetics Surgery and Septum Deviation Surgery Be Done Separately?</h3><p>The nose should be evaluated as a whole with its function and important place in facial appearance. Curvatures in the nasal cartilage often cause problems in the appearance of the nose. <strong class=\"text-blue-600\">If you have a complaint about the shape of the nose or if you think that I want to change my nose shape in the future, it would be better to have both surgeries together.</strong></p></div><div class=\"bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg\"><h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4\">What Does Concha Mean? What Does It Do?</h3><p class=\"mb-4\">Concha are protrusions on the side wall of the nose resembling a radiator in the nasal cavity. These structures regulate and warm the air during the breathing process. In some cases, these structures may be larger than they should be. This makes breathing difficult.</p><p class=\"font-semibold text-green-600\">If the large size of these structures creates a problem, these structures can also be reduced with rhinoplasty.</p></div></div>"
